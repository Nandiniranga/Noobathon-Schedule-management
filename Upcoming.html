    <h1> <STRONG><em>UPCOMING EVENTS</em></STRONG> </h1>
    <p1> <br> <strong>28th March 2023 - ELECTROBOTS </strong><br><br> Can you believe that the fantasy of being able to communicate with a non-living virtual being is a reality now!<br>

        Yes, you are right, they are none other than bots! A bot is a software application that usually imitates repetitive and simple human activities on the internet like automated messaging, which will be much faster than humans. So ECEA in collaboration with the Robotics club, is here with Electrobots to demonstrate how bots work and how electronics is at the heart of these bots.
        
        <br>Make sure to join us and discover how smart these bots can be!<br>
        
        <br>Date and Time: 25th March, 5:00 PM<br>
        Venue: EC 219 (ECE Department)<br><br>  </p1>

        <br> <strong>30th March 2023 - GIT and GITHUB WORKSHOP </strong><br><br>
        Ever had an interesting project idea but your other teammates donâ€™t study at NIT Warangal so you felt stuck on how to carry out your project? Had a teammate who changes lines of code without telling you and you have no way to find what was changed?<br>

        The EA & HAM Club is back again to help you kill two birds with one stone with our brand new Git and GitHub workshop. Take up this opportunity to learn how to collaborate with people far away from you and manage all your work with precise coordination. Bring your brilliant ideas, discussed on video calls, into reality!<br>

        A widely used web-based Git repository hosting service, GitHub allows users distributed revision control so each person can individually contribute effectively. Git on the other hand is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in your source code during software development.<br>
